I build AI systems that solve the problems I've spent a career navigating — from identity platforms serving 700K users to data systems unifying 89M records across 28+ sources. I've led $20M+ portfolios at Salesforce with 5/5 CSAT and cut delivery cycles by 67%.

## AI Agent Research — 10 Deterministic Agents

Purpose-built agents spanning compliance, testing, fairness, documentation, and operational intelligence. Every repo uses deterministic, auditable logic — identical inputs always produce identical outputs. Zero black boxes.

### The Flagship

**[governed-llm-gateway](https://github.com/NathanMaine/governed-llm-gateway)** — Route LLM requests through a governed endpoint with SHA-256 hash-chain audit trails, Merkle tree verification, YAML policy-as-code enforcement, PII detection, and SOC 2 + HIPAA compliance evidence packages mapping 12 regulatory controls.

### Testing & Validation

| Repository | What It Does | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| [voice-robustness-testing-agent](https://github.com/NathanMaine/voice-robustness-testing-agent) | Tests voice/NLU classifiers with pluggable protocols and regex keyword scoring | 3-state outcome model |
| [architectural-design-review-agent](https://github.com/NathanMaine/architectural-design-review-agent) | YAML architecture briefs → structured LLM reviews with JSON schema extraction | SHA-256 evidence integrity |
| [compliance-validation-agent](https://github.com/NathanMaine/compliance-validation-agent) | Assesses software changes against compliance checklists using category-aware keyword matching | Real analysis without LLM |
| [agent-perf-test-generator](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agent-perf-test-generator) | Generates load test plans (steady/burst/soak) from service profiles with SLO-derived checks | Auto burst threshold relaxation |

### Documentation & Knowledge

| Repository | What It Does | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| [living-docforce-agent](https://github.com/NathanMaine/living-docforce-agent) | Detects documentation drift across Flask + Express with path normalization | Version-aware, zero LLM dependency |
| [meeting-memory-companion](https://github.com/NathanMaine/meeting-memory-companion) | Extracts structured meeting data and answers queries via 6-category classification | Token-overlap scoring with evidence |

### Operations & Intelligence

| Repository | What It Does | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| [ai-ops-kpi-pipeline](https://github.com/NathanMaine/ai-ops-kpi-pipeline) | ETL pipeline with suffix-based heuristic aggregation (totals summed, latency averaged) | Zero external dependencies |
| [devex-metrics-dashboard](https://github.com/NathanMaine/devex-metrics-dashboard) | 7 DORA-aligned health categories with signal-counting aggregation | Prevents single-metric domination |

### Fairness & Governance

| Repository | What It Does | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| [multi-agent-fairness-governor](https://github.com/NathanMaine/multi-agent-fairness-governor) | Weighted round-robin task allocation with priority ordering and capacity constraints | Fully deterministic, skew-ratio metric |

## Enterprise AI Toolkit

Production-grade tools for teams deploying AI agents in enterprise environments.

| Tool | Problem It Solves |
|------|-------------------|
| [**Governance Graph Compiler**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/governance-graph-compiler) | Automates SOC2/SOX control-to-evidence traceability — replaces weeks of manual mapping |
| [**Agentic Evaluation Sandbox**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agentic-evaluation-sandbox) | Regression testing for non-deterministic AI agents with scenario batteries and baselines |
| [**Agentic Memory Graph Engine**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agentic-memory-graph-engine) | Persistent, queryable agent memory using RAG and knowledge graphs |
| [**Self-Healing Agentic Workflows**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/self-healing-agentic-workflows) | Automatic retries, fallback chains, and circuit breakers for AI pipelines |
| [**Temporal Executive Agent**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/temporal-executive-agent) | Temporal planning by dependencies and due dates → plan + state |
