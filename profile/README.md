# 👋 Welcome — Start Here

If you’re exploring my work, these three projects are the best place to begin.  
They show the core themes across my portfolio: **real-time intelligence, agentic AI, governance, workflow orchestration, and developer experience automation.**

---

### 🚀 **1. Project Aurora Echo — Real-Time Meeting Intelligence**  
Real-time audio → transcription → reasoning → structured memory.  
*If you only look at one project, make it this one.*  
🔗 https://github.com/NathanMaine/Project-Aurora-Echo  

---

### 🧪 **2. Compliance Validation Agent — Governed Agentic Flows**  
Demonstrates governance-first agent behavior, rule enforcement, and structured validation for enterprise workflows.  
🔗 https://github.com/NathanMaine/compliance-validation-agent  

---

### 🧩 **3. Agentforce Data-Aware Agent — Metadata-Aware Safe Actions (Salesforce)**  
Auto-discovers org schema → enforces FLS/sharing → runs safe Apex/Flow actions.  
🔗 https://github.com/NathanMaine/Agentforce-Data-Aware-Agent  

---

### 📚 **Full Portfolio (24 Public Projects)**  
This portfolio includes **10 core agentic AI prototypes** plus **14 supporting experiments** across real-time intelligence, Salesforce automation, classical AI, developer tooling, and creative systems.
