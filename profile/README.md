I deliver enterprise platforms that power critical business outcomes — from identity systems serving 700K users to data platforms unifying 89M records across 28+ sources. I've led $20M+ portfolios at Salesforce with 5/5 CSAT and cut delivery cycles by 67%.

AI systems that solve the problems I've spent a career navigating.

## 🎯 Start Here

Three projects that show the core themes: **real-time intelligence**, **agentic AI**, **governance**, and **developer automation**.

| | Project | What It Does |
|--|---------|--------------|
| 🚀 | [**Project Aurora Echo**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/Project-Aurora-Echo) | Real-time audio → transcription → reasoning → structured memory. *Start here.* |
| ✅ | [**Compliance Validation Agent**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/compliance-validation-agent) | Governance-first agent behavior, rule enforcement, structured validation. |
| 🌿 | [**Agentforce Data-Aware Agent**](https://github.com/NathanMaine/Agentforce-Data-Aware-Agent) | Auto-discovers org schema → enforces FLS/sharing → runs safe Apex/Flow. |

## 🏢 Enterprise AI Toolkit

Production-grade tools for teams deploying AI agents in enterprise environments. Each solves a real problem I encountered building agentic systems at scale.

| Tool | Problem It Solves | Link |
|------|-------------------|------|
| **Governance Graph Compiler** | Compliance teams spend weeks manually mapping controls to audit evidence. This automates SOC2/SOX control-to-evidence traceability. | [→ Repo](https://github.com/NathanMaine/governance-graph-compiler) |
| **Agentic Evaluation Sandbox** | AI agents are non-deterministic — traditional testing doesn't work. This provides regression testing with scenario batteries and baseline comparisons. | [→ Repo](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agentic-evaluation-sandbox) |
| **Agentic Memory Graph Engine** | Most agents are stateless and forget everything. This adds persistent, queryable memory using RAG and knowledge graphs. | [→ Repo](https://github.com/NathanMaine/agentic-memory-graph-engine) |
| **Self-Healing Agentic Workflows** | AI pipelines crash when APIs timeout or LLMs hallucinate. This adds automatic retries, fallback chains, and circuit breakers. | [→ Repo](https://github.com/NathanMaine/self-healing-agentic-workflows) |

Built with Python. Designed for teams who need **reliability**, **compliance**, and **observability** in their AI deployments.
